The coming document describes the charectar encoding for the masav file: https://www.masav.co.il/media/2001/hebrew.pdf.

In this repository there includes a full solution for creating a masav Zikuim file.
There are two options:
1. Enter all the data in a customized form and dowloading it as a msv file.
2. Upload an exsiting file and editing the files data and downloding the editied data in a new file.
